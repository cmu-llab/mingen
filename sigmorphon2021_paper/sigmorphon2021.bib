  abstract = {I argue for lexical representations of Arabic verbs in which consonants and vowels are represented together (Berent et al. 2007), as in all other languages. I claim that the vowel choice of imperfective verbs is determined by the consonants surrounding the imperfective vowel. In addition, I argue that native speakers learn the impact of consonants on the imperfective vowel selection and consequently extend their knowledge to nonce verbs. Existing analyses focusing on Semitic languages such as Modern Standard Arabic (Brame 1970, Gafos 2003, Shekeri \& Scheer 2004, 2005, Rosenthall 2006) claim that such languages require a particular structure of lexical representations; they require a consonantal root. Instead of arguing in favor of a special morphemic structure exclusive to Semitic languages, I propose universal representations. In order to test the hypothesis, I created a corpus of Urban Hijazi Arabic verbs belonging to four verb types, monosyllabic [aa], monosyllabic [a], disyllabic [a], and disyllabic [i]. Studying the lexical trends of the imperfective of Hijazi Arabic, four natural classes, emphatics, liquids, nasals and gutturals, seem to influence the choice of imperfective vowel. In order to check whether the patterns can be learned and generalized, I employ a rule-based learner, the Minimal Generalization Learner (Albright \& Hayes 2002, 2003, 2006). Findings from lexical decision and production experiments with auditory stimuli support the stem hypothesis; the presence of emphatics, for instance, affects the imperfective vowel choice of all four verb types. Although the MGL successfully learns the trends of the imperfective vowel, its predictions follow the lexicon too closely relative the experimental results. I present a constraint-based analysis using the MaxEnt learner. With its default settings, the learner gives expected probabilities similar to the predictions of the MGL. I show that unlike the MGL, the MaxEnt grammar has the flexibility necessary to account for variability in the imperfective choice through adding biases against source oriented constraints. This improvement to the model is one of the main contributions of this work.},

I present a model of morphological learning that posits rules and seeks to infer their productivity by comparing their reliability in different phonological environments. The result of this procedure is a grammar in which general rules exist alongside more specific, but more reliable, generalizations describing subregularities for the same process. I present results from a nonce-probe (WUG) experiment in Italian, in which speakers rated the acceptability of novel infinitives in various conjugation classes. These results indicate that such subregularities are in fact internalized by speakers, even for a regular morphological process.},

  abstract = {Are morphological patterns learned in the form of rules? Some models deny this, attributing all morphology to analogical mechanisms. The dual mechanism model (Pinker, S., \& Prince, A. (1998). On language and connectionism: analysis of a parallel distributed processing model of language acquisition. Cognition, 28, 73 \textendash{} 193) posits that speakers do internalize rules, but that these rules are few and cover only regular processes; the remaining patterns are attributed to analogy. This article advocates a third approach, which uses multiple stochastic rules and no analogy. We propose a model that employs inductive learning to discover multiple rules, and assigns them confidence scores based on their performance in the lexicon. Our model is supported over the two alternatives by new ``wug test'' data on English past tenses, which show that participant ratings of novel pasts depend on the phonological shape of the stem, both for irregulars and, surprisingly, also for regulars. The latter observation cannot be explained under the dual mechanism approach, which derives all regulars with a single rule. To evaluate the alternative hypothesis that all morphology is analogical, we implemented a purely analogical model, which evaluates novel pasts based solely on their similarity to existing verbs. Tested against experimental data, this analogical model also failed in key respects: it could not locate patterns that require abstract structural characterizations, and it favored implausible responses based on single, highly similar exemplars. We conclude that speakers extend morphological patterns based on abstract structural properties, of a kind appropriately described with rules.},

  abstract = {Russian velar palatalization changes velars into alveopalatals before certain suffixes, including the stem extension -i and the diminutive suffixes -ok and -ek/ik. While velar palatalization always applies before the relevant suffixes in the established lexicon, it often fails with nonce loanwords before -i and -ik but not before -ok or -ek. This is shown to be predicted by the Minimal Generalization Learner (MGL), a model of rule induction and weighting developed by Albright and Hayes (Cognition 90: 119\textendash 161, 2003), by a novel version of Network Theory (Bybee, Morphology: A study of the relation between meaning and form, John Benjamins, 1985, Phonology and language use, Cambridge University Press, 2001), which uses competing unconditional product-oriented schemas weighted by type frequency and paradigm uniformity constraints, and by stochastic Optimality Theory with language-specific constraints learned using the Gradual Learning Algorithm (GLA, Boersma, Proceedings of the Institute of Phonetic Sciences of the University of Amsterdam 21: 43\textendash 58, 1997). The successful models are shown to predict that a morphophonological rule will fail if the triggering suffix comes to attach to inputs that are not eligible to undergo the rule. This prediction is confirmed in an artificial grammar learning experiment. Under either model, the choice between generalizations or output forms is shown to be stochastic, which requires retrieving known word-forms from the lexicon as wholes, rather than generating them through the grammar. Furthermore, MGL and GLA are shown to succeed only if the suffix and the stem shape are chosen simultaneously, as opposed to the suffix being chosen first and then triggering (or failing to trigger) a stem change. In addition, the GLA is shown to require output-output faithfulness to be ranked above markedness at the beginning of learning (Hayes, Phonological acquisition in Optimality Theory: the early stages, Cambridge University Press, 2004) to account for the present data.},

  title = {Evidence for Base-Driven Alternation in {{Tgdaya Seediq}}},
  author = {Kuo, Jennifer},
  year = {2020},
  abstract = {Standard approaches to morphophonological analysis of paradigms require positing URs from which surface contrasts can be derived. Often, URs are `cobbled', in that they combine information from multiple forms of the paradigm, and do not necessarily correspond to any single surface form (Kenstowicz and Kisseberth, 1977: 33). In contrast, Albright (2002, et seq.) argues for a single surface base approach, where the UR must be based on the surface forms of one slot in the paradigm. In Tgdaya Seediq (Austronesian: Taiwan), all forms of a paradigm (non-suffixed vs. suffixed) suffer from some loss of contrasts, making it a good test case for comparing between the two theories of morphophonology. In this thesis, I conduct an empirical study of Seediq verbal alternations, and find support for Albright's surface base hypothesis. This thesis consists of three parts: First, based on a corpus on 340 Seediq verb paradigms, I describe the patterns of alternation in Seediq, and show how asymmetries in the data make it so that the suffixed forms of a paradigm are highly predictable from the non-suffixed forms. In the second part, I use a computational rule-based model to confirm this asymmetry, and show that such an asymmetry is expected under Albright's single surface-base hypothesis, but unexpected under the traditional cobbled UR approach. Finally, based on these results, I develop a theoretical surface-base model of Seediq verbal alternations, which takes surface non-suffixed forms as inputs. The model uses Zuraw's (2000; 2010) dual listing framework to model speaker intuitions, and is implemented in Maximum Entropy Harmonic Grammar (Goldwater and Johnson, 2003), a stochastic variant of Optimality Theory (Smolensky, 1986; Prince and Smolensky, 1993).},

  abstract = {The acquisition of English noun and verb morphology is modeled using a single-system connectionist network. The network is trained to produce the plurals and past tense forms of a large corpus of monosyllabic English nouns and verbs. The developmental trajectory of network performance is analyzed in detail and is shown to mimic a number of important features of the acquisition of English noun and verb morphology in young children. These include an initial error-free period of performance on both nouns and verbs followed by a period of intermittent over-regularization of irregular nouns and verbs. Errors in the model show evidence of phonological conditioning and frequency effects. Furthermore, the network demonstrates a strong tendency to regularize denominal verbs and deverbal nouns and masters the principles of voicing assimilation. Despite their incorporation into a single-system network, nouns and verbs exhibit some important differences in their profiles of acquisition. Most importantly, noun inflections are acquired earlier than verb inflections. The simulations generate several empirical predictions that can be used to evaluate further the suitability of this type of cognitive architecture in the domain of inflectional morphology.},

Individuals vary considerably in the degree to which they prefer irregular forms. This article examines the degree to which individuals may converge on their regularization patterns and preferences. We report on a novel experimental methodology, using a cooperative game involving nonce verbs. Analysis of participants' postgame responses indicates that their behavior shifted in response to an automated co-player's preferences, on two dimensions. First, players regularize more after playing with peers with high regularization rates, and less after playing with peers with low regularization rates. Second, players' overall patterns of regularization are also affected by the particular distribution of (ir)regular forms produced by the peer., We model the effects of the exposure on participants' morphological preferences, using both a rule-based model and an instance-based analogical model (Nosofsky 1988, Albright \& Hayes 2003). Both models contribute separately and significantly to explaining participants' pre-exposure regularization processes. However, only the instance-based model captures the shift in preferences that arises after exposure to the peer. We argue that the results suggest an account of morphological convergence in which new word forms are stored in memory, and on-line generalizations are formed over these instances.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the role of analogy in the changes in inflectional classes of Swedish verbs from the Old Swedish to Modern Swedish period. Verbs in the Germanic languages are generally classed as either weak or strong according to their type of inflection, but closer examination reveals interesting subtleties and exceptions to this general picture. Furthermore, changes in inflectional class go in different directions: not only from strong to weak, but also the other way around, and between strong classes and weak classes. Two analogical computer models \textemdash{} Analogical Modeling (Skousen 1989) and Minimal Generalization (Albright \&amp; Hayes 2002) \textemdash{} are used to model a selection of 80 such changes in the history of Swedish verbs. Taking only phonological descriptions of present tense verb stems paired with their original past tense stems as input, the models attempt to predict the most likely past tense forms based on analogy. In the cases where the new outcome matches the actual changes in Swedish, the predictions are considered correct. In this way, both models predicted roughly half of all changes correctly, but 83\% of the changes where a weak verb became strong. I conclude that analogy modeled in this way may play a moderate to strong role in inflection class change in general, but a particularly strong role in the case of new strong verbs. Based on these results, analogy is deserving of a revaluation as an explanatory force in diachronic linguistics.},

  abstract = {Two opposing viewpoints have been advanced to account for morphological productivity, one according to which some knowledge is couched in the form of operations over variables, and another in which morphological generalization is primarily determined by similarity. We investigated this controversy by examining the generalization of Portuguese verb stems, which fall into one of three conjugation classes. In Study 1, an elicited production task revealed that the generalization of 2nd and 3rd conjugation stems is influenced by the degree of phonological similarity between novel roots and existing verbs, whereas the 1st conjugation generalizes beyond similarity. In Study 2, we directly contrasted two distinct computational implementations of conjugation class assignment in how well they matched the human data: a similarity-driven model that captures phonological similarities, and a dual-mechanism model that implements an explicit distinction between context-free and similarity-based generalizations. The similarity-driven model consistently underestimated 1st conjugation responses and overestimated proportions of 2nd and 3rd conjugation responses, especially for novel verbs that are highly similar to existing verbs of those classes. In contrast, the expected proportions produced by the dual-mechanism model were statistically indistinguishable from human responses. We conclude that both context-free and context-sensitive processes determine the generalization of conjugations in Portuguese, and that similarity-based algorithms of morphological acquisition are insufficient to exhibit default-like generalization.},
