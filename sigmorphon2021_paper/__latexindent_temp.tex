\section{Introduction}

In a landmark paper, \citet{albright2003} proposed a model that learns morphological rules by recursive \textbf{minimal generalization} from lexeme-specific examples (\emph{e.g.}, \textipa{I} $\to$ \textipa{2} / \textipa{st} \underline{\ \ \ } \textipa{N} for \emph{sting $\sim$ stung} and \textipa{I} $\to$ \textipa{2} / \textipa{fl} \underline{\ \ \ } \textipa{N} for \emph{fling $\sim$ flung} generalized to  \textipa{I} $\to$ \textipa{2} / X [$-$syllabic, $+$coronal, $+$anterior, \ldots] \underline{\ \ \ } \textipa{N}).\footnote{The square brackets contain the shared phonological feature specifications of /t/ and /l/, which in the feature system used here are xxx.} The model was presented more formally in \citet{albright2002a}, along with evidence that the rules it learns for the English past tense give a good account of native speakers' productions and ratings in wug-test experiments (\emph{e.g.} judgments that \textit{splung} is quite acceptable as the past tense of the novel verb \textit{spling}). In addition to providing further analysis of the experimental data, \citet{albright2003} compared their proposal with early connectionist models of morphology \citep[\emph{e.g.,}][]{plunkett1999} and an analogical or `family resemblance' model inspired by research on psychological categories \citep{nakisa2001}.

Along with \citet{albright2002b}, which presents a parallel treatment of Italian inflection, Albright \& Hayes's study of the English past tense is a paradigm example of theory-driven, multiple-methodology, open and reproducible research in cognitive science.\footnote{Albright \& Hayes released both the results of their wug-test experiments and an implementation of their model (visit \url{http://www.mit.edu/~albright/mgl/} and \url{https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/RulesVsAnalogy/index.html}). An impediment to large-scale simulation with the model is that it runs from a GUI interface only. As part of the present project, we have added a command line interface to the original source code (available on request).} Their model has enduring significance for the study of morphological learning and productivity in English \citep[\emph{e.g.,}][]{racz-etal-2014-rules, racz2020a, corkery-etal-2019-yet} and many other languages (\emph{e.g.,} Hijazi Arabic: \citealt{ahyad2019}; Japanese: \citealt{oseki-etal-2019-inverting}; Korean: \citealt{albright2009}; Navajo: \citealt{albright2006}; Portuguese: \citealt{verissimo2014}; Russian: \citealt{kapatsinski2010a}; Tgdaya Seediq: \citealt{kuo2020}; Spanish: \citealt{albright2003}; Swedish: \citealt{strik2014}).


In this paper, we apply a partial reimplementation of the Albright \& Hayes model to wug-test rating data from three languages (Dutch, English, and German) collected for the SIGMORPHON-UniMorph 2021 Shared Task. Our version of the model is based purely on minimal generalization of morphological rules, as described in \S3.1 of \citet{albright2002a} and reviewed below. It does not include additional mechanisms for learning phonological rules, and expanding or reigning in morphological rules, that were part of the original model \citep[see][\S3.3 - \S3.7]{albright2002a}. We think there is much to be gained from considering minimal generalization on its own, with the other mechanisms ablated away, as borne out by competitive results on the shared task. For convenience, we refer to the original model as \textbf{mingen} and our bare-bones version as \textbf{mingen0}.

\subsection{Outline}


\section{Model Description}

\textbf{Inputs} \quad The model takes as input a set of wordform pairs, one per lexeme, that instantiate the same morphological relationship. In simulations of English past tense formation, these are pairs of bare verb stems and past tense forms such as $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{wOk}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{wOkt}$\ltimes$$\rangle$, $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{tOk}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{tOkt}$\ltimes$$\rangle$, $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{stIN}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{st2N}$\ltimes$$\rangle$, $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{flIN}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{fl2N}$\ltimes$$\rangle$, and $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{k2t}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{k2t}$\ltimes$$\rangle$. Wordforms consist of phonological segments (here, in broad transcription) delimited by special beginning and end of string symbols. The set $\Sigma$ of phonological segments, and the set $\Sigma_{\#} = \Sigma \ \cup \ \{ \rtimes, \ltimes \}$, are assumed to be given to the model.

The model also requires a phonological feature specification for each of the symbols that appears in wordforms. We used a well-known feature set, augmenting it with orthogonal feature specifications for the delimiters $\rtimes$ and $\ltimes$.\footnote{The phonological feature specifications are available from Bruce Hayes's website, \url{https://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/120a/Index.htm\#features}. xxx binary with 0s xxx original features distribued with the model included scalar features xxx for example. Alternative binary (with underspecification) feature sets are xxx phoible xxx panphon.} $\Phi$ is the set of all possible (partial) feature specifications over the chosen set and $\phi(x)$ gives the features of $x \in \Sigma_{\#}$.

\textbf{Base rules} \quad For each wordform pair, the model constructs a lexeme-specific morphological rule by first identifying the longest common prefix excluding $\ltimes$ (C), then the longest common suffix from the remainder (D), and finally identifying the remaining symbols in the first (A) and second (B) members of the pair. The symbol $\varnothing \notin \Sigma_{\#}$ denotes the empty string.\footnote{In other common notations, the empty string is denoted by $\lambda$. xxx by construction can occur only in A or B} The rule formed from $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{wOk}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{wOkt}$\ltimes$$\rangle$ has the components C = $\rtimes$\textipa{wOk}, D = $\ltimes$, A = $\varnothing$ and B = \textipa{t} (\emph{i.e.}, $\varnothing$ $\to$ \textipa{t} / $\rtimes$\textipa{wOk} \underline{\ \ \ } $\ltimes$). The rule for $\langle$$\rtimes$\textipa{k2t}$\ltimes$, $\rtimes$\textipa{k2t}$\ltimes$$\rangle$ is $\varnothing$ $\to$ $\varnothing$ $\rtimes$\textipa{k2t} \underline{\ \ \ } $\ltimes$.

\textbf{Minimal Generalization} \quad Given any two base rules $R_1$ and $R_2$ \emph{that make the same change} (A $\to$ B), the model forms a possibly more general rule by aligning and comparing their contexts. The minimal generalization operation, $R = R_1 \sqcap R_2$, carries over the common change of the two base rules and applies independently to their left-hand ($C_1$, $C_2$) and right-hand ($D_1$, $D_2$) contexts. For convenience, we define minimal generalization of the right-hand contexts. Minimal generalization of the left-hand contexts can be performed by reversing $C_1$ and $C_2$, applying the definition for right-hand contexts, and reversing the result.

The minimal generalization $D = D_1 \sqcap D_2$ is defined precedurally by first extracting the longest common prefix ($\sigma_{1\land2}$) of the two contexts and then operating on the remainders ($D_1'$, $D_2'$). If both $D_1'$ and $D_2'$ are empty then $D = \sigma_{1\land2}$. If one but not both of them are empty then $D = \sigma_{1\land2}X$, where $X \notin \Sigma_{\#}$ is a variable over symbol sequences (\emph{i.e.}, $X$ stands for $\Sigma_{\#}^*$). If neither is empty, then the operation determines whether their first two symbols have any shared features; for this purpose it is useful to consider $\phi(x)$ as a function from symbols to sets of feature-value pairs, in which case the common features are found by set intersection.

If there are no common features, $\phi_{1\cap2} = \emptyset$, then as before $D = \sigma_{1\land2}X$. Otherwise, the set of common features $\phi_{1\cap2} \neq \emptyset$ is appended to $\sigma_{1\land2}$, the first symbol is removed from $D_1'$ and $D_2'$, and the operation applies to the remainders. If both remainders are empty then $D = \sigma_{1\land2} \phi_{1\cap2}$, otherwise $D = \sigma_{1\land2}\phi_{1\cap2}X$.

In summary, the generalized right-hand context $D$ consists of the longest common prefix shared by $D_1$ and $D_2$, followed by a single set of shared features (if any), followed by $X$ in case there are no shared features or one context is longer than the other. With the change and generalized left-hand context $C$ determined as already described, the result of applying minimal generalization to the two base rules is $R = A \to B / C \ \underline{\ \ \ } \ D$.\footnote{There could be a small difference between our definition of context generalization and that in \citet{albright2002a}, hinging on whether the empty feature set is allowed in rules. In our definition, $\phi_{1\cap2} = \emptyset$ is replaced by the variable $X$. It is possible that the original proposal intended for empty and non-empty feature sets to be treated alike. The definitions can diverge when applied to contexts that are of identical length and share all but the last (resp. first) segments, in which case our version would result in a broader rule.}

\subsection{Hyperlinks}

Users of older versions of \LaTeX{} may encounter the following error during compilation: 
\begin{quote}
\tt\verb|\pdfendlink| ended up in different nesting level than \verb|\pdfstartlink|.
\end{quote}
This happens when pdf\LaTeX{} is used and a citation splits across a page boundary. The best way to fix this is to upgrade \LaTeX{} to 2018-12-01 or later.
